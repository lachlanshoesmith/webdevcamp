# webdevcamp

[webdevcamp](https://webdevcamp.day) is a platform designed to not only make managing web development bootcamps easy, whbut also empower attendees to share their efforts with others in a way that is as public or private as they want.

I begun this project as an employee of Skill Samurai, who host single-day coding 'camps' for young children. I saw an opportunity; I could bring some of my webdev-frontend-knowhow to this buzzing business and introduce a new and interactive course designed specifically for young people. With this in mind, I wanted to develop a tool that abstracts away the challenges that come with hosting such a broad suite of student's websites. Hence, webdevcamp. ðŸŒž
