  <!--
    Welcome to your HTML file!
    This is all of the words, pictures, and other such things
    on your website go.
    
    It's also how we define the structure of the website and how
    different bits of content are grouped together.

    However, note that the HTML code itself does very little to
    define what the website looks like.

    P.S: This section is a comment! A comment is a section of your
    code that the computer ignores when it runs your code.
    It's useful for adding little notes that explain things that
    might not make total sense at a glance.

        This is the <head> section. A lot of important information about
        your website that the browser needs to know goes here.

  <!--
    This <link> tag makes sure your CSS file is recognised when
    the website is loaded. Without it, the website won't look
    how you like.
    
    In this case, I've placed it after the <body> tag so that it
    doesn't delay the loading of all our important content within the
    <body> tags.

    If you want to avoid this, you can instead move this link tag to
    go within the <head> section, and that's okay too. 😄

    All the same can be said of the <script> tag pointing to index.js.
    We will cover JavaScript if we have time. ✌️
